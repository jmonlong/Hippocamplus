I compile markdown documents using the [RMarkdown R package](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) (which uses [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)).

~~~sh
Rscript -e 'rmarkdown::render("document.md")'
~~~

The output format is either defined in the YAML header (see below), or can be specified with `output_format=`.

Note: In [Emacs](../emacs/#to-render-rmarkdown), I use a custom key binding to run this command on the current buffer.


## Markdown tips

+ Insert images with `![](image.jpg)`.
+ `/` to add some vertical space/break (e.g. in slides).
+ Use two `` ` `` and a space to escape `` ` `` in inline code. E.g ``` `` `pwd` `` ``` gives `` `pwd` ``.
+ `---` to add horizontal line/separation.
+ Comments using: `[//]: # (This is a comment)` or `<!-- This is a comment -->`
+ Insert page breaks with `\newpage` (also works on some non-LaTeX-based outputs).

## YAML header

Common info for the YAML header

~~~yaml
---
title: My title
subtitle: My subtitle
author: Jean Monlong
date: Oct 23, 2023
---
~~~

## Bibliography

To use BibTeX references from a `library.bib` file, add to the YAML header:

~~~yaml
---
bibliography: library.bib
csl: style.csl
link-citations: true
---
~~~

A lot of CSL styles can be found at the [Zotero Style Repository](https://www.zotero.org/styles).

Cite with `@bibtexid` or `[@bibtexid]` (to add parenthesis).
Multi-citations with `[@id1; @id2]`.

## Markdown to PDF report

Some YAML header options ([see documentation for more](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#variables-for-latex)):

~~~yaml
---
output:
  pdf_document:
    keep_tex: true
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    includes:
      in_header: header.tex
linkcolor: NavyBlue
urlcolor: NavyBlue
documentclass: article
papersize: a4
fontsize: 11pt
geometry: margin=2cm
---
~~~

- `header.tex` can be used to define custom LaTeX packages/commands to use.

## Markdown to Word document

Some YAML header options:

~~~yaml
---
output: word_document
---
~~~

## Markdown to HTML pages

RMarkdown creates self-contained HTML documents that look good and are easy to share.

Some YAML header options:

~~~yaml
---
output: 
  html_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
    toc_float: true
    code_folding: hide
---
~~~

## Markdown to slides

### PDF slides

Using Beamer:

~~~yaml
---
output:
  beamer_presentation:
    slide_level: 2
    theme: "default"
    colortheme: "dolphin"
    fonttheme: "structurebold"
---
~~~

Pick a theme from [https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/](https://hartwork.org/beamer-theme-matrix/) (for example).

### HTML slides

Some YAML header options:

~~~yaml
---
output: 
  ioslides_presentation:
    widescreen: true
    css: style.css
---
~~~

I used the `style.css` file to make sure the images are sized properly and don't overflow.
For example, this CSS code seemed to help:

~~~css
img {
    max-width:100%;
    max-height:400px;
    height: auto;
    width:auto;
}
~~~

In this mode, the user can use key bindings such as `f` (**f**ullscreen), `w` (**w**idescreen), `o` (**o**verview), `p` (**p**resenter [notes](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/ioslides-presentation.html#presenter-mode)).

#### Incremental bullet points

Use the blockquote syntax:

~~~md
> - First things first
> - But also this
~~~

## Websites

### blogdown websites

[blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) is a R package extending [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to build [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static websites.
Hugo is easier to install than Jekyll and apparently faster. Most importantly blogdown makes it easier to write posts with R code like in a RMarkdown document.

I still use GitHub Pages to deploy the website. 
GH Pages doesn't support Hugo, so I build the website in a `docs` folder (`publishDir = "docs"` in `config.toml`) which I set up on the website settings to be the source of the static website. 

#### Themes

There are several themes [available](https://themes.gohugo.io/). 
I keep using the [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) themes, Hyde and Lanyon, that have been [made available for Hugo](https://github.com/tummychow/lanyon-hugo).

#### Table of Contents

In the YAML header of a page:

~~~yaml
output:
  blogdown::html_page:
    toc: true
~~~

#### Draft posts

Most of the time I would like to build the website with minimal recompilation and I don't want the draft posts to show (except for previews).

`build_site()` builds the site without showing posts with YAML `draft: true`. 
But it also recompiles everything and that can be a pain. 

`serve_site()` recompiles only the *Rmd* documents newer than the corresponding *HTML* but it builds all posts, even if they have the *draft* parameter.

For minimal recompilation and hidden draft posts I do `hugo_build()` after a `serve_site()`. 

#### Math formulas

Using [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/mathjax.html) JavaScript display engine, I followed the instruction in the [blogdown documentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/templates.html#how-to) and added to the footer partial:

~~~html
<script src="//yihui.name/js/math-code.js"></script>
<script async src="//cdn.bootcss.com/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js?config=TeX-MML-AM_CHTML">
</script>
~~~

Then inline formulas are surronded by \$ (for equations use two \$), and they follow [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

#### Bibliography

In the YAML header:

~~~
bibliography: [../../static/library.bib]
link-citations: true
~~~

I also use [a script to reduce the BibTeX file](https://github.com/jmonlong/Hippocamplus/tree/config/python/reduceBib) used (see [this post](/2018/11/17/speedup-blogwdown-pandoc-large-bibliography/)).
Otherwise, large BibTeX files or large author lists make the rendering extremely slow.

### Jekyll websites (deprecated)

Note: I now use *blogdown* for markdown-based websites, see above.

[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) websites are simple Markdown documents that can be converted into a website. 
[GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) uses it to provide a website for a repo.

#### Themes

There are several themes [available](http://jekyllthemes.org/). My favorites are the two [Poole](http://getpoole.com/) themes, Hyde and Lanyon.

#### Table of Contents

`kramdown` automatically creates TOC if it sees :

~~~markdown
* Is replaced by the TOC
{toc}
~~~

To make it a bit nicer I created a `toc.html` file in the `_include` folder with:

~~~html
<nav>
  <h4>Table of Contents</h4>
  * TOC
  {:toc}
</nav>
~~~

Then I call the TOC in each markdown document using (without the `\`):

~~~markdown
\{\% include toc.html \%\}
~~~


#### Math formulas

I use [MathJax](http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/mathjax.html) JavaScript display engine. I added to the *head* of the pages:

~~~html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" ></script>
~~~

Then inline formulas are defined by `\\(...\\)` (for equations, use `\\[...\\]`), and they follow [LaTeX syntax](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Mathematics).

For example, `\\(\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}\\)` produces $\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\mathrm{d}x = \sqrt{\pi}$.





## R Markdown

I put information about running R code in a R Markdown document in the [R section](../r/#rmarkdown).
