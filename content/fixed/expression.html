<h1>Writing</h1>
<p>Some recommendations from <a href="https://www.sportsci.org/jour/9901/wghstyle.html">Sportscience</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>i.e.</em> and <em>e.g.</em> only within parenthesis (is that a thing?)</li>
<li>aim for economy.</li>
<li><em>However</em> or synonyms at most once per paragraph.</li>
<li><em>while/since</em> for time related stuff, not instead of <em>whereas/although/because</em>.</li>
<li>Don’t start sentence with <em>because/as/since</em>.</li>
<li>Adverb after verb.</li>
</ul>
<p>What I noticed that I’m doing wrong sometimes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>aim to verb</em> instead of <em>aim at verb-ing</em>.</li>
<li>Using simple <em>be</em> instead of “fancy” verbs (e.g. represent).</li>
<li>Shorter sentences. E.g. <em>… This explains…</em> instead of <em>…, which explains…</em>.</li>
<li>Place <em>such as</em> at end of the sentence when possible.</li>
<li>The verb <em>represent</em> might be a faux-ami.</li>
</ul>
