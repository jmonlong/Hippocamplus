# Writing

Some recommendations from [Sportscience](https://www.sportsci.org/jour/9901/wghstyle.html):

- *i.e.* and *e.g.* only within parenthesis (is that a thing?)
- aim for economy.
- *However* or synonyms at most once per paragraph.
- *while/since* for time related stuff, not instead of *whereas/although/because*.
- Don't start sentence with *because/as/since*.
- Adverb after verb.

What I noticed that I'm doing wrong sometimes:

- *aim to verb* instead of *aim at verb-ing*.
- Using simple *be* instead of "fancy" verbs (e.g. represent).
- Shorter sentences. E.g. *... This explains...* instead of *..., which explains...*.
- Place *such as* at end of the sentence when possible.
- The verb *represent* might be a faux-ami.

## Grammarly lessons

- less `which`, and more `that`
    - `sequencing data produces data *that* tools can use for...`
- avoid separating `to <verb>`
    - `to better study` -> `to study better`
    - `to better characterize` -> `to characterize better`
    - `to quickly produce XX` -> `to produce XX quickly`
- `in order to` -> `to`
- less of `will be verb-ing` and more `will verb`
- less wordy
    - `in particular` -> `particularly`
    - `take into account X` -> `account for X`
- `not only X but also Y` -> `X and Y`
- `X of the Y` -> `Y X`
- `with the verb-ing` -> `verb`
    - `help with the interpretation of X` -> `help interpret X`
- `that is/are` -> ` `
- `it is more <adj> to verb than to verb` -> `verb-ing is more <adj> than verb-ing`
- `the <noun> of X` -> `<verb>-ing X`
    - `the identification of variants` -> `identifying variants`
- `X, which <verb>` -> `X, <verb>ing`
- `will have a large impact on` -> `will greatly impact`
- `In the near future` -> `Soon`
- `get better` -> `improve`
- `in the years to come` -> `in the coming years`
- `to ensure that the` -> `to ensure the`

## Synonyms

- `identify`: `pinpoint`

# Oral Expression

- *Now* as a transition word, e.g. when changing slides.
- *In closing, ...* to introduce the conclusion slide.

## Advices

- Don't be a parrot, aka don't read the slides and say things differently.
- Have fun.
- Make jokes.
- Articulate.

	- Put yourself in a "I love this subject" enthusiast mood.
	- Don't learn your talk, learn your subject. Then you just have to talk about your slides.
	- No conclusions if talk is short.
	- Don't read acknowledgments.
	- Tell a story, not a list of analysis.
